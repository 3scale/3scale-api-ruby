## Design

Design decisions:

* 0 runtime dependencies
* thread safety
* tested

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

## Testing

To run tests run `rake` or `rspec`.

There are two kinds of tests: unit (see [spec/api](spec/api)) and integration (see [spec/integration](spec/integration)).

For running the integration tests you will need to have a real 3scale account, you can set the details of the account via environment variables. The easiest way to set everything up is it to have a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following environment variables (set your own values):

```
ENDPOINT=https://your-domain-admin.3scale.net
ACCESS_TOKEN=abc123
SERVICE_ID=12345
METRIC_ID=12345 # should be a numeric value, not the system name
APPLICATION_PLAN_ID=12345
```

**Note:** for the tests to pass the following requirements need to be met:
- authorization mode of the service should be *API key*
- there should be at least 1 method for the 'hits' metric
- the field `billing_address` should be added to the Account model in **Settings > Fields Definitions**

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
